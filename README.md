This peroject is my second experience of using unity game engine. It's a simple game and it does not have any special stuff.   
But I love it beacuse I like unity and it's a good Game Engine. I recomend you to use it. I dont mean the game :).  
I mean unity.  
The game has not finished. I will add some other functionalities to it in the future
